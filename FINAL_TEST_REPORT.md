## Success Stories

## Conclusion

The scraper suite has a **35% success rate** with significant room for improvement. The parallel TMUX approach successfully updated all scrapers, but site-specific challenges remain. The working scrapers (Lobbyfacts, UK ORCL, French HATVP) demonstrate the system can extract substantial client data when properly configured.

**Next Steps**:
1. Focus on fixing the 5 non-working scrapers
2. Improve reliability of partially working scrapers
3. Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
4. Consider alternative approaches for complex JavaScript sites
